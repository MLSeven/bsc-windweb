CumulusMX Custom Web Page Budworth Sailing Club

Contains the HTML, scripts and CSS for the BSC Weather Station web powered by Cumulus MX

The contents of this Repo should be dropped into the root of the Web Server.

The HTML pages are pre-processed to replace markup tags with the current recorded values by CumulusMX and then FTP'd up to the site so the fact that this repo contains no HTML is OK

To complete the process a second repo needs deploying to the device running CumulusMX so the the HTML pages are created correctly
